# ⚡ StakePeek Blitz - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the fastest drop-claiming technology on Stake. Follow these steps to initialize your system.

## 1. Installation
Since this is a high-performance specialized tool, you must load it manually into your browser:

1.  **Download** and extract the `StakePeekBlitz.zip` file.
2.  Open your browser (Chrome or Brave) and navigate to: `chrome://extensions`
3.  Enable **"Developer mode"** (top right toggle).
4.  Click **"Load unpacked"** (top left).
5.  Select the `extension` folder from your extracted files.

## 2. Activation
1.  Click the **StakePeek** icon in your browser toolbar (pin it for easy access).
2.  Paste your unique **License Key** into the input field.
3.  Click **"Activate System"**. 
4.  The status should change to **ACTIVE**.

## 3. Maximizing Strike Speed
To achieve the advertised **sub-400ms** speeds, follow these pro tips:

*   **Keep a Tab Active**: Always keep at least one tab of `stake.com` or `stake.us` open. The extension uses these active connections to "warm" the network path.
*   **Stay Logged In**: Ensure you are logged into your Stake account in the browser.
*   **Minimize Network Noise**: For the fastest possible response, avoid heavy streaming or downloads while waiting for drops.
*   **Monitor Daily/High**: Toggle these settings in the popup to choose which channels you want the bot to strike.

## 4. Support
If you encounter any issues, please contact your vendor through the platform where you purchased your license.
