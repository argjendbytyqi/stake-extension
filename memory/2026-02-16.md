## StakePeek Blitz: The Sub-300ms Update

### Speed & Logic Upgrades
- **Sub-300ms Strike Engine**: Moved from JSON processing to "Pre-Warmed" string payloads.
- **Queue Bypass**: First claim attempt now fires instantly, bypassing the drop queue.
- **Captcha Warmer**: Created `warmer.js` to harvest Turnstile tokens from a background `/offers` tab.
- **Token Management**: Added 90s age validation and auto-refresh (10m idle) for the warmer tab.
- **UI Interaction**: Replaced `setInterval` with `MutationObserver` for instant "Redeem" button clicking.
- **Telegram Listener**: Integrated directly into `server.py` lifespan; updated regex to be much more robust (catches generic alphanumeric codes).

### Extension Pro UI Overhaul
- **Design**: Sleek Dark/Cyberpunk theme branded as **StakePeek Blitz**.
- **User Stats**: Added grid for Expiry Date and Lifetime Claims.
- **Performance Tracking**: Added "Last Strike Speed" display in milliseconds.
- **UX**: Added Activate/Disconnect toggle that persists the license key.

### Fixes & Cleanup
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Fixed multiple "Unavailable" entries in activity feed using client-side `processedCodes` tracking and server-side DB checks.
- **Submodule Sync**: Synchronized all logic between server and extension.
- **Git Safety**: Moved `licenses.db` to `.gitignore` to prevent production data overwrites.
- **License Recovery**: Created `server/restore_license.py` to recover lost license entries.

### Project State
- Repository: `stake-extension`
- Latest Stable Commit: `fac7c22` / `440ddcb`
- Logic ready for commercial SaaS deployment.
