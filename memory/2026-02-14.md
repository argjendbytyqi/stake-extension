- User provided a residential proxy for testing.
- Created `stake-automation/stake_monitor_res.py` to use the provided residential proxy.
- Updated `.env` with proxy credentials.
- Script uses the confirmed `claimBonusCode` GraphQL mutation with mandatory `turnstileToken`.
- Configured to run in headless mode since the residential IP should bypass initial WAF blocks.
- **Project Pivot**: Moved to `stake-extension` architecture for commercial-grade reliability.
